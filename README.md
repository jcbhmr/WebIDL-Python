The document's structure is intended to mimic the [JavaScript binding section](https://webidl.spec.whatwg.org/#javascript-binding) of the Web IDL standard and take inspiration from [the Java binding for Web IDL](https://www.w3.org/TR/WebIDL-Java/).

Some other prior art resources from how other ecosystems have started adopting Web IDL (or Web API bindings) into their own language idioms are the [web-sys](https://crates.io/crates/web-sys) crate from the Rust ecosystem and _TODO_.
